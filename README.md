# RustPlayer - Music in the CLI, made easy.
RustPlayer uses *your* MP3's from your music folders to automatically shuffle through songs in the CLI! RustPlayer supports Linux, macOS and Windows meaning you can use it ANYWHERE for ANYTHING.<br>
You can contribute to RustPlayer simply by forking the repository!<br>

## Flags
You can run RustPlayer with the following flags:<br>
--dir > You can specify a specific directory you want the app to search for MP3 files in.<br>
skip > In the program after running it, if you type skip, it will skip the song and move onto the next one.<br>

## Planned Features
A GUI is planned alongside support for more file types like FLAC and WAV.<br>

## Data Collected
At current NO data is collected however in the future we may collect basic information like OS information for debugging and to allow us to get an idea of which operating system we need to run development for mainly.
